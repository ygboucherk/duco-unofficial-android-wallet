# DUCO unofficial Android Wallet
This is a [Duino-Coin](https://github.com/duino-coin) unofficial android wallet using http API. It also allows wrapping your duino-coins on Tron blockchain for putting them in DeFi.

## Wallet
We can send transactions, check our balance, etc... with this wallet, that was intended to be easy to use.


## Wrapper
Wrapper allows to wrap your DUCO on the tron blockchain, and trade them on [justswap](https://justswap.io), store them on external wallets like [tronlink](https://dapp.tronlink.org/#invitecode?code=Ff51&lang=en), [trust wallet](https://trustwallet.com) or [ledger](https://www.ledger.com/).

### Wrap
Simply wrapping DUCO to wDUCO. Set an amount and click "wrap". Then DUCO will be debited and wDUCO will be credited.

### Unwrap
Unwrapping wDUCO. It will only debit your wDUCO and credit you DUCO.

### Send Wrapped
This option allows you to send your wrapped DUCO to any valid tron address (out of the system).

Please double-check it's the correct address (a dialog will ask u) before sending because of funds sent to the wrong address CANNOT BE RECOVERED.


## A big thanks
Big thanks to [@furim](https://github.com/furim) for the VPS

## Donate
I handle all the tron fees involved by wrapper (it also took me so much time to code), so any donate is welcome.

You can donate to the wrapper's tron address : [TMpidRmkmZv1jgenvR5APdgJTQAgTWFScL](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TMpidRmkmZv1jgenvR5APdgJTQAgTWFScL).
